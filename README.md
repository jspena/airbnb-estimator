Airbnb’s hosts aren’t professional hoteliers. They don’t have sufficient experience to appropriately price their listings. Inorder to address this  business  problem,  data  science  methods  can  be  used  to  develop  pricing  algorithms  to  provide guidance  for  hosts. This  can  be  done  by  exploring  available  data  of  current  listings  with  clustering techniques,  identifying attributes that affect price and building models to predict  the  prices  for various Airbnb listings. One of the use case scenarios is creating a price recommendation system for hosts in order to propel appropriate timely pricing.
